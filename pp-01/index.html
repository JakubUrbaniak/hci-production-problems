      Playfair Display is the first of the two typefaces I chose as a pair.
      There are two primary discriptions that stand out.
      The first: "it became to pring letterforms of high contrast and
      delicate hairlines."
      The second: The family has been converted to a variable font in 2019.
      Typeface pairings are easy!

    Lora
  </h1>
    <p id="lora">
      Lora is the second typface in the pairing, there are some clear similarities
      in certain information about the two Fonts, see if you can spot them.
      The two big things that Lora had that stood out (and was similar to PD)
      The first: "roots in calligray ... typeface with moderate contrast"
      The second: "the family has been update to a variable font family"
      To be honest I spent way too much time trying to find a pairing.
