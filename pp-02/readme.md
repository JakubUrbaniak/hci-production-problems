## ITMD 362, Production Problem 02: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site
Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Before you start, be sure to read through the color theory readings on the course calendar for Week
Four.

Once you’ve read, you’ll choose a palette based on each prompt below, and paste the Paletton URL in
with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the `uid` value in the Paletton URL changes with each
adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode “Default with Text,” so you can see how text looks on each palette
you choose. Use the Preview tab at the bottom of the palette preview.

1. A **monochromatic color palette** for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: #uid=10i0u0kllll++ZJv+vNaGaT000r
Your Rationale: I chose an orange-red monochromatic color for my color scheme when introducing a new gaming platform.
I chose this color because of the excitement and energy a new console should bring to all the fans.
Used correctly it should bring about an eye appealing and emotion eliciting experience to a user.
Of course, the end choice for a console colors palette should be the same as the theme of the console.

2. An **adjacent color palette** for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: #uid=52Q0R0kllll++T0w0uFaGc0002F
Your Rationale: I chose a green-yellow-blue adjacent color scheme for a springtime feeling.
I feel like the green brings about a feeling of what spring is, which is where grass is growing and
nature is beginning to thrive. The yellow complements it for a similar reason of the sun shining and
bringing about a feeling of spring warmth. And finally, the blue adds to the calming nature of spring
after experiencing the roughness of winter.

3. A **triadic color palette** for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL: #uid=35D0X0ksOrQi0z6mVtSupm8Afhb
Your Rationale: When you think of kids, you think of short attentions spans and lots of energy.
Thus, some kind of color scheme that is exciting and popping is needed to reel in the attention
of them. So I chose a Red, Blue, Yellow scheme that is as bright as possible without hurting the eyes.
The red and yellow give off a feeling of excitement, while the blue helps tame the overall feel
of the page without taking too much of a hit. The primary colors are also a bonus for kids
as it is easily identifiable for them.

4. A **custom color palette** for advertising a course on cybersecurity
