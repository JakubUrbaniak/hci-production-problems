## ITMD 362, Production Problem 03: Implementing HCI Guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

You’ve read about HCI guideline’s throughout Josh Clark’s *Designing for Touch*. This Production
Problem is your opportunity to apply them to an existing form.

Using the HCI guidelines from either iOS or Android, sketch a new small-screen touch-friendly design
for the membership account-creation page for Chicago’s Museum of Contemporary Art at https://experience.mcachicago.org/account/create (Hint: visit the URL on your phone).

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

Choose from either Apple’s or Google’s design guidelines:

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/
* Google Material Design 3 Guidelines:
  https://m3.material.io

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1. Photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook, or digital sketches
2. An explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guideline One (URL): https://m3.material.io/components/navigation-bar/guidelines
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: I created a small navigation icon bar on the bottom of the screen.
This will allow for the user to be taken to a link that will have all of the information that pretains to each subject
and allow the user to choose the options. This will be a cause for less clutter on the screen.

* HCI Guideline Two (URL): https://material.io/components/text-fields
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: Remove some of the less necessary interface options
and include only required information. Also created a clear divide between each section of information being inputted.
I don't expect as drastic of a color change as what I did, but I made it obvious that the purpose behind the dividing
lines is to include some new field of information. All of the extra information (such as prefixes) can be included in a
settings menu after the account is created.

* HCI Guideline Three (URL): https://material.io/components/banners#behavior
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: Instead of having the menu option on a long bar
on the left side of the screen I created a little button that can be selected to access the same information.
I also made the title of the page (account creation for this instance) be included in the menu. Then to make
the screen more readable I made it so that the banner menu options vanish if you scroll down without touching the
top of the screen, but can come back by pressing an arrow to access it.

For the Production Problem discussion next week, be sure to share your sketches and chosen
guidelines.
